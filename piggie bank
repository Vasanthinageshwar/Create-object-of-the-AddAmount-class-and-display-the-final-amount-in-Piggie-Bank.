Suppose you have a Piggie Bank with an initial amount of Rs. 50 and you have to add some more amount to it. Create a class
'AddAmount' with an instance variable named 'amount' with an initial value of Rs. 50. Now make two constructors of this class as
follows:
1 - without any parameter - no amount will be added to the Piggie Bank
2 - having a parameter which is the amount that will be added to Piggie Bank
Create object of the 'AddAmount' class and display the final amount in Piggie Bank.
Hint: Read the amount to be added from the user through keyboard

CODE:

import java.util.*;
class AddAmount
{
int amount = 50;
AddAmount()
{
}
AddAmount(int i)
{
amount = amount + i;
}
}

class Que2_A3
{
public static void main(String args[])
{
Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
int num=sc.nextInt();
AddAmount obj1 = new AddAmount();
AddAmount obj2 = new AddAmount(num);
System.out.println(obj1.amount);
System.out.println(obj2.amount);
}
}
